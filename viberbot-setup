Using Viber to receive notification messages has less problems that the SMS systems for me.
The setup is a bit complicated due to the idea of using Viber + API  to deliver a SMS to a number.

I. Creating a Viber Bot:
1. Go to https://partners.viber.com/login and login with your current Viber account.
2. Create a Bot Account filling the necessary information
3. Save the given unique to the bot token

II. Set a webhook for the bot: (https://developers.viber.com/docs/api/rest-bot-api/#setting-a-webhook)

- IMPORTANT: The hydrachain notification system uses the Viber bot only to send messages.
Viber bot uses webhooks to deliver messages sent to the bot from users, when a new users has subscribed/unsubscribed.
For that reason it requires to setup a webhook (url, which will receive these events)
Because we want just sending to us and easy setup you will place the facebook domain for webhook url.
The information sent from the Hydrachain Staking Notification to the user is 100% secure.
The information sent from the User to the URL is not 100% secure, because the domain isn't ours.
For that reason do not sent anything from the Viber App to the Bot.

In Postman create a POST request to https://chatapi.viber.com/pa/set_webhook with raw JSON body:
{
   "auth_token": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
   "url":"https://facebook.com",
   "event_types":[
      "subscribed",
      "unsubscribed",
      "message"
   ],
   "send_name": false,
   "send_photo": false
}
- We only need the subscribed event type, but by default it will subscribe to the three above even if we didn't provide them.
- You can always update the url, even_types, name & photo at later stage with that requests

III. Acquired your account id:
Open Postman.
Make GET request to https://chatapi.viber.com/pa/get_account_info with raw JSON body:
{
   "auth_token": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
}
In the response there is a members field containing your account id.
    "members": [
        {
            "id": "xxxx/xxxxxxx+xxx==",
            "name": "xxx xxx",
            "role": "admin"
        }
    ]
Save your id (xxxx/xxxxxxx+xxx==)

IV. Your are all set.
Now you can provide your viber-botid and viber-userid
